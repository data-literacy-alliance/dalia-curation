# Curation comments for NFDI Sektion Metadaten AG Cookbooks collection

- Curated input file:
  [Resources (DIF) - section-metadata-wg-cookbooks resources.csv](<Resources%20(DIF)%20-%20section-metadata-wg-cookbooks%20resources.csv>)
- Row numbers refer to the curated csv file and not the original Google
  Spreadsheet. IDs refer (a) to the _Resource Local ID_ column (if an ID exists
  there) and (b) to the _DALIA_ID_ column.

- In the _Authors_ field URLs to Wikidata pages were used. These are not the
  correct URIs to Wikidata entities (aka _Concept URIs_). Corrected.
- In the _Keywords_ field URLs to Wikidata pages were used. (a) These are not
  the correct URIs to Wikidata entities (aka _Concept URIs_). (b) Our
  application cannot handle these URIs at the moment, and to be honest we do not
  have any concept for handling them yet. Thus, those URLs were substituted with
  their label from the Wikidata page in the language of the respective learning
  resource.
- In the _LearningResourceType_ field:
  - Compact URIs (CURIEs) were used (e.g. "mo:Cookbook" instead of "Cookbook").
    This might be due to ambiguity in the DIF document. Corrected.
  - Corrected several entries, so they work in the mapping. (Spelling of the
    labels or substituting labels with URIs from HCRT)
- other corrections/notes:
  - row 3 (cb3, 69aebdfe-73f6-4bac-85d7-047dd8cec076): license looks correct;

Notes for the DIF group:

- Learning resource type "Video" was used, which comes from
  [hcrt:video](https://w3id.org/kim/hcrt/video). This kind of clashes with the
  media type "Video".
- Learning resource type "Sonstiges" was used, which comes from
  [hcrt:other](https://w3id.org/kim/hcrt/other).
