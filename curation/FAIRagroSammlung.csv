From this fundamental principle, we move forward. Namely, how to recognize and put into practice the scalable solution that’s right for your situation. The insights and tools of this course are regardless of programming language, but user-friendly examples are provided in Python, Hadoop HDFS, and Apache Spark. Although these principles can also be applied to other sectors, we will use examples from the agri-food sector.

Agri-food deserves special focus when it comes to choosing robust data management technologies due to its inherent variability and uncertainty. Wageningen University & Research’s knowledge domain is healthy food and the living environment. That makes our data experts especially equipped to forge the bridge between the agri-food business on the one hand, and data science, artificial intelligence (AI) on the other. 
Combining data from the latest sensing technologies with machine learning/deep learning methodologies, allows us to unlock insights we didn't have access to before. In the areas of smart farming and precision agriculture, this allows us to:
Better manage dairy cattle by combining animal-level data on behaviour, health and feed with milk production and composition from milking machines. Reduce the amount of fertilizers (nitrogen), pesticides (chemicals), and water used on crops by monitoring individual plants with a robot or drone. More accurately predict crop yields on a continental scale by combining current with historic data on soil, weather patterns and crop yields.
In short, this course’s foundational knowledge and skills for big data prepare you for the next step: to find more effective and scalable solutions for smarter, innovative insights.",https://w3id.org/kim/hochschulfaechersystematik/n003 * https://w3id.org/kim/hochschulfaechersystematik/n371,,Data Science * Big Data * Immutability * Artificial Intelligence * Scalability * Machine Learning,en,https://w3id.org/kim/hcrt/course * https://w3id.org/kim/hcrt/drill_and_practice * Article * Tutorial,text * video,competent,,researcher,,,

Organized by the NFDI4Biodiversity consortium, the Winter School fostered data literacy and promoted sustainable research practices within the ecological and environmental science communities.

The publication offers an overview of the Winter School's structure, curriculum, and highlights. Throughout the course, participants engaged in a series of expert-led lectures and hands-on practical sessions, delivered by renowned academics, data specialists, and research institutions in the biodiversity domain. These sessions covered critical aspects of RDM, encompassing data collection, curation, analysis, visualization, and long-term preservation.

The curriculum extensively explored state-of-the-art software tools for data handling, including Jupyter notebook, R, Python, RightField, and OpenRefine. By providing hands-on training with these tools, the Winter School empowered participants to enhance their data management workflows and produce robust research outcomes.

Targeting PhD students and Early-Career Researchers, the Winter School nurtured the next generation of scientists, equipping them with the necessary skills to navigate the challenges posed by increasingly complex and diverse ecological datasets.

By sharing insights, lessons learned, and practical guidance, this publication serves as an invaluable reference and guide for organizers, educators, and researchers seeking to create impactful and inclusive training programs in research data management for biodiversity and related studies.

Since published content is essential for scientific research over long time periods, reusability should not be limited by the life-time of a format. 
Various other limitations like unclear usage rights may also impact reuse in the scientific context.

This presentation regarding format recommendations, including surveys and an exercise, was held at the international BonaRes Data Workshop ""Make the best of your data"" (29. 09. 2021) by ZALF and ZB MED. The workshop aimed to introduce scientists to efficient management and proper tools that support scientists in their daily work in general and specifically when using the BonaRes Data Repository.

The presentation introduces the challenge of format diversity, which is explained in relation to digital preservation methods. Recommendations for format types when publishing data are given: open, text-based and popular formats. Further recommendations regarding files are conveyed: files without passwords, sufficient rights information and metadata. Following the recommendations supports data reusability over the long term. An exercise for the participants, ranking formats according to their suitability for digital preservation, is included. Similarly, the participants' answers to surveys regarding used data types and file formats, as well as data reuse issues are added.",https://w3id.org/kim/hochschulfaechersystematik/n003,.pdf,Digital Preservation * File Formats * BonaRes * Research Data Management,en,Lecture,presentation,novice * advanced beginner,2021-12-16,teacher (higher education),,2.3,

In both cases, preparation will help you along the way. This highly interactive workshop aims to provide you with the knowledge and basic tools needed to plan & execute your journey in an efficient and useful way.
Keeping your data organized, understandable, and safe are key components of your daily work. Furthermore, preparing your data according to best practices like the FAIR principles helps in publishing and collaboration.
After an introduction of the stages research data goes through and the actions required to efficiently manage your results, we will explore best practices relevant to planning, structuring, storing, and publishing of research data. The IPK provides tools to support these efforts, and we will collect hands-on experience working with them.

In the workshop, we will provide an overview of the special features associated with the management and data sharing of social science data. We will focus in particular on data protection, the contextualisation/documentation of data sets and the secure storage and publication of data.
