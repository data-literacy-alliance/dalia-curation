However, the analysis of sequencing results can still be challenging.
In this webinar, we provide an introduction to single cell sequencing, especially RNA sequencing. Which protocols are used? What are common quality measures? How can I correct for some quality issues? Which tools should I use to process my data, and is there a data processing standard? These are the first questions we want to tackle. In addition, the webinar will explain general analyses procedures and highlight workflows that are being used to unravel RNA sequencing results. We go deeper into singe cell analysis and the webinar will explain buzzwords, such as normalization, dimensional reduction, data integration, and cell label transfer.

Why is it important and what are the challenges? How is consent given and are there tools that can help to set up consent forms? How can I check if consent given in an earlier study is compliant with current ethical and legal requirements? These are the questions this webinar wants to discuss. 

Sharing of genomic and other omics data collected in research studies or in clinical settings is key to improve the development of diagnostic tools and to drive personalised medicine forward. Given the sensitive nature of genomic and other health data it is crucial that patients and study participants are well informed about the use of their data and voluntarily consent to sharing it. 

However, researchers and clinicians needing to obtain consent to work with human omics data often face challenges: whether it is understanding the interplay between the legal and ethical role that consent plays, or struggling to write consent forms and assess whether older consent forms can be used to meet current ethical and legal standards.

This webinar aims to provide information for students, researchers and clinicians, but also people working with medical databases (bioinformaticians, data stewards and data protection officers) on the importance and the challenges around research consent. It will also showcase tools that can help setting up consent forms and assess existing consent.",,,,en,Lecture,multipart,,2022-10-07,,,,

To get you started, this webinar covers the general concepts behind hypothesis testing workflows, including summary statistics, null and alternative hypotheses, and p-values. We focus specifically on what you should pay attention to when you interpret results from a biostatistical analysis. We're using gene expression as an example, and work with visuals rather than equations, to make the topic accessible to a broader audience.

Especially large scale or high throughput experiments often require appropriate computational techniques and tools for analysing the data - and it is not always obvious which method to choose best.

This webinar aims to provide an overview on good statistical practice for students and researchers who are planning to perform experiments resulting in large biological datasets. We discuss efficient workflow design, iterative analyses, data representation, computational methods and most importantly, we will address the question of “how many replicates?”.
