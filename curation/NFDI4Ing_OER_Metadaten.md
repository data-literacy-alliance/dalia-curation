Review by Moritz

- Discipline changed to format of Hochschulfächersystematik
- added a missing space in author list
- added a . in file format (.pdf)
- removed the unit size, because mb is standard
- (SR) is added to the community (specified by Agnes)

Notes for the DIF group:

- In the column for LearningResourceType, a MediaType was initially specified. I
  therefore moved the MediaType to its appropriate place. Under
  LearningResourceType, I added the classification “lecture”.

Duplicates: None

Missing communities:
