# DALIA Curation

This repository contains open educational resources (OERs) curated by the DALIA
team in the DALIA Interchange Format (DIF).

## Contributing

1. read the
   [curation guide](https://github.com/data-literacy-alliance/dalia-dif/blob/main/docs/curation.md)
   to understand the tabular format.
2. After signing in to GitHub, do one of the following:
   1. edit a file in the repository by navigating through the
      [curation/](curation/) folder then press the pencil icon in the top-right
      corner. Click the big green button to create a commit then again the next
      big green button to create a PR.
   2. add a new file following this tutorial
      https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository

This repository is set up to use continuous integration (CI) to run a validation
on all CSV files on commits and pull requests, so you will get immediate
feedback on any errors.

## Exports

The curated OERs encoded in the DIF v1.3 schema can be downloaded as
[`dalia-dif13.ttl` (RDF)](https://github.com/data-literacy-alliance/dalia-curation/raw/refs/heads/main/export/dalia-dif13.ttl)
or
[`dalia-dif13.jsonl` (JSON lines)](https://github.com/data-literacy-alliance/dalia-curation/raw/refs/heads/main/export/dalia-dif13.jsonl).

The DALIA Knowledge Graph (DALIA-KG) combines both the OERs encoded in the DIF
v1.3 schema and the ontologies underlying the fields inside the data model. It
can be downloaded from
[`dalia-dif13-full.ttl` (RDF)](https://github.com/data-literacy-alliance/dalia-curation/raw/refs/heads/main/export/dalia-dif13-full.ttl).
It incorporates both the original DALIA curations (licensed under CC0) and:

1. Learning resource types are imported from
   [Hochschulcampus Ressourcentypen](https://github.com/dini-ag-kim/hcrt) (CC0)
2. Disciplines are imported from
   [Hochschulf√§chersystematik](https://github.com/dini-ag-kim/hochschulfaechersystematik)
   (unlicensed,
   [see discussion](https://github.com/dini-ag-kim/hochschulfaechersystematik/issues/30))

## Case Study

The following SPARQL query federates the DALIA-KG and NFDI4Chem to connect
training materials in DALIA about the instruments used to produce data in
experiments in Chemotion.
